                    <p class="w3-medium w3-text-sand">
                        Orange County has its share of Indian restaurants and markets at which you may have encountered a chaat dish.
                        But at the new Wok N Tandoor in Orange, you can revel in an entire galaxy of chaat.
                        And since it's a food made to be eaten casually, often on the street,
                        it's appropriate this restaurant is its first true ambassador to OC.
                        The place took up the space of a taquería and didn't do much to the layout except add a new coat of paint.
                        Ordering chaat at a fancier venue such as, say, white-tablecloth sister restaurant Wok N Tandoor in Artesia
                        would be as incongruous as eating a dirty-water hot dog at Marche Moderne.
